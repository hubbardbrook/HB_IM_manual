    "text": "1.1 History of IM at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest\nThis chapter is based on the most recent Data Management Plan (DMP) developed for the 2022 LTER site renewal proposal. Subsequent chapters expand on each element and reflect recent accomplishments and detailed instructions on the various workflows used in the HBR Information Management environment. Also available is the full 2022 HBR DMP as originally submitted.\nThe Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF; USDA Forest Service) was established in 1955 and became an NSF-funded Long Term Ecological Research Site (HBR) in 1988. Information management has been an important component at Hubbard Brook from its inception. Data and documents from 1955 onward have been stored and protected, and although most of these early items consist of physical assets (paper charts, photographic slides, field notes, handwritten data, publications, etc), much of this material has been converted to digital format, with original copies in fireproof storage at the HBEF Pierce Lab and at the Northern Research Station in Durham, NH.\nThe establishment of the LTER-HBR occurred at a time of rapidly changing technology; desktop computers and email were new, and the internet as we know it was still several years away. The Hubbard Brook community fully embraced these emerging technological resources, and established access to data with the ‘Source of the Brook’, a public access dial-up electronic bulletin board, which allowed easy retrieval of many data sets from the HBR (1990). From a dialup bulletin board and gopher server in the early 1990s, to the World Wide Web in the late 1990s, HBR’s latest technology advances in publicly sharing data and resources has seen a migration of the website to WordPress, a data catalog built on dynamic access to content in the Environmental Data Initiative repository (EDI), bibliography management in Zotero, to name a few…\nUntil 2012, Information management for HBR was provided through the Forest Service, with John Campbell filling this role from 1997-2012. During this time, the LTER network adopted EML (Ecological Metadata Language) as a metadata standard, and HBR was an early adopter of this standard. In 2003-4 the first EML-based data packages were prepared for HBR with online download access and formatted browser display of metadata.\nFunding for the HBR Information Management position was provided in the 2010 renewal of LTER-HBR funding (HBR5), and the position was filled in mid-2012 by Mary Martin (Earth Systems Research Center, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH).",

    "text": "1.3 Research Approval Committee\nA Research Approval Committee (RAC) has been established to assist the Forest Service and broader HBES community in making decisions regarding what research studies will be allowed. In making its recommendation, the RAC considers a number of factors related to: (1) the relationship of the proposed project to the overall Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (how does this project fit into the overall study; why is it important for this research to occur at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, as opposed to some other site); (2) the scientific merit of the proposed research; (3) the integrity of the site (e.g. how will this research impact the Forest or other ongoing research projects); and (4) the extent to which the proposed research compromises or enhances ongoing efforts. The RAC’s critical review of proposed research at Hubbard Brook helps ensure that the scientific value of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest is maintained for the future.\nProposal submissions to the RAC are made through JotForm webforms on https://hubbardbrook.org/research/research-proposal-submission, and are currently being used to develop a project-level database to support the RAC review process and IM tracking of data collections at Hubbard Brook. Researchers approved by the RAC are encouraged to submit data to be included in the Hubbard Brook Data Catalog, regardless of funding source.",

    "title": "1  Data Management Plan",
    "section": "1.5 Data Packages",
    "text": "1.5 Data Packages\n\n1.5.1 Overview\nHBR data packages are prepared for submission to the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI), following best practices developed over 4 decades by the LTER Information Management community (https://ediorg.github.io/data-package-best-practices/eml-best-practices.html). These best practices, and the efforts of the EDI, ensure that data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, following the principles of the FAIR initiative. The EDI serves as the primary repository for HBR data, and details about the operation of EDI can be found at https://edirepository.org.\n\n\n1.5.2 Data Holdings\nThe HBR data catalog has had a strong emphasis on long-term datasets and data from the major watershed experiments. Many of these data pre-date the establishment of LTER-HBR, and are now available as a result of a 60+ year culture of robust data curation and sharing. More than 20 HBR data packages have been collected over a period of 50 or more years, with another 30 covering a timespan of more than 20 years. Through close coordination with the Research Approval Committee, the Hubbard Brook Committee of Scientists, and project administration, HBR-IM is able to identify datasets that can be incorporated into our data catalog. Graduate students working at Hubbard Brook are also surveyed periodically to identify forthcoming datasets and they are also trained in the EDI data publication workflow.\n\n\n1.5.3 Metadata Standards\nAll HBR data packages are prepared for submission through the development of metadata in the Ecological Metadata Language standard (EML; https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/eml-ecological-metadata-language). Basic EML content includes: title, abstract, personnel, contacts, publication date, spatial and temporal coverages, keywords (consistent with LTER controlled vocabulary), project funding, publisher, data access and use policies, and detailed attribute-level metadata. Data download and use is facilitated through the fully described attribute metadata (column names, definitions, units, missing values, and coding). The highest level of EML completion is achieved through the EDI congruency checker with informational, warning, and error messages that provide feedback to HBR-IM on additional steps that can (or must) be taken to submit to the repository. These congruency checks read both metadata and data, testing a minimum of 40 conditions that can be addressed to insure that data packages are are fully capable of integration with other data, and fully operational in higher level workflows and automated data processing.\nIn 2019, LTER sites began using EML2.2. EML2.2 provides the structure to accommodate a number of advanced metadata elements. Of note, is the ability to annotate data packages at the data package, entity, and attribute level, by linking to persistent identifiers in ontologies, such as those found at https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies and elsewhere. As the annotation elements in EML2.2 become populated, both the discoverability of datasets, and the ability to use datasets in synthesis efforts will be enhanced. HBR-IM has been a member of both the EDI Semantics Working Group (formed in January 2019), and the EDI/LTER Units Working group (2023-present), which have a goal of developing best practices and training on the use of the new EML2.2 annotation elements. The Units Working Group is responsive to recommendations from the LTER 40-year review on facilitating synthesis efforts. This has been accomplished by establishing a relationship with the QUDT ontology (https://qudt.org), developing code to map ad hoc units to this ontology, and preparing a manuscript on this effort for publication.\n\n\n1.5.4 Data Package Development\nHBR IM has fully adopted the EDI ezEML application for data package development. This cloud-based application was developed by EDI and users are supported by the EDI team and ezEML developer. This application continues to be developed to support emerging LTER/EDI data requirements. Within this system, HBR can store templates for access and re-use of common metadata elements (people, taxonomy, geographic coverage, funding, etc). EzEML also supports a ‘collaboration’ mode, where IM and data creators can work together to complete the full metadata documentation necessary for the repository.\nA separate chapter describes the data package development workflow in detail: HBR Data Package Development.\n\n\n1.5.5 Data Quality Control\nThe HBR research community is widely dispersed among different institutions and laboratories, and data quality control is implemented primarily by the individual researcher. All data packages include methods, wherein detailed data QC protocols can be documented. The HBR-IM works with research teams to document quality control in the data package metadata as appropriate. This may range from descriptions directly in EML, PDF files uploaded with data packages, or cross referencing to details on data QC available elsewhere. IM provides the data submitter with feedback on a number of QC checks that are implemented during the data package development workflow. These include value ranges for data table attributes, coding consistency, and additional issues that are flagged within the ezEML environment and the EDI congruency checker (the final checks during repository upload).\n\n\n1.5.6 Access Policy\nThe HBR data policy follows that of the LTER Data Access Policy, as updated in 2017. (https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/; Creative Commons license - Attribution - CC BY; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). All pre-existing HBR data packages have been revised to include this new policy, and the policy is linked on the hubbardbrook.org information management page. The policy reads as follows:\n\nThis information is released under the Creative Commons license - Attribution - CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The consumer of these data (“Data User” herein) is required to cite it appropriately in any publication that results from its use. The Data User should realize that these data may be actively used by others for ongoing research and that coordination may be necessary to prevent duplicate publication. The Data User is urged to contact the authors of these data if any questions about methodology or results occur. Where appropriate, the Data User is encouraged to consider collaboration or co-authorship with the authors. The Data User should realize that misinterpretation of data may occur if used out of context of the original study.\nWhile substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and associated documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available “as is.” The Data User should be aware, however, that data are updated periodically and it is the responsibility of the Data User to check for new versions of the data. The data authors and the repository where these data were obtained shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of the data.\n\n\n\n1.5.7 Data Access\nThe complete inventory of Hubbard Brook data can be browsed, filtered, and searched on the HBR website https://hubbardbrook.org/d/hubbard-brook-data-catalog. Data are also discoverable through both the EDI data portal (https://portal.edirepository.org), through DataONE (https://search.dataone.org), google dataset search (https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), and through DataCite (https://datacite.org), the entity providing dataset DOIs to EDI. A separate stand-alone document is generated as needed (for proposals and reviews), and describes all HBR data packages in the EDI (and other) repository – Hubbard Brook Data Catalog Inventory.",

HBR completed a website migration from html/php files to a content management system (CMS; Drupal) in 2017. In 2022 the website was further migrated to WordPress. With cloud-based WordPress hosting, it becomes simpler to transfer website management to a different IM and/or institution. Website content is managed by the HBR IM and the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation. The website provides access to data, publications, personnel pages, education and outreach material, and a photo gallery. A recent website content addition is the Hubbard Brook Research Synthesis – an online ‘book’ consisting of 19 chapters to date, covering a wide range of long-term research. With content editors assigned to each chapter, this is meant to be a series of dynamic pages, which reflect the full history of Hubbard Brook research in each topic area (https://hubbardbrook.org/online-book). Chapters in the online book contain numerous data figures, many of which have been restructured to read data directly from the most recent data revisions in the EDI repository.\nSee Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study Website Management Guide for website configuration, access to servers and filesystems, recommended practices for site content, etc.",

    "text": "1.10 Sample Archive\n\n1.10.1 Samples\nIn 1990, an archive facility was built at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest to store samples permanently so that they will be available for future research. The 1860 sq. ft. building consists of two rooms: a larger unheated room (30 x 46 ft.) and a smaller room (16 x 30 ft.) heated to just above freezing in the winter. The larger room is uninsulated and is subject to large variations in temperature and humidity; the most scientifically valuable samples are stored in the smaller, insulated, heated room.\nThe archive building now houses approximately 70,000 samples of soil, water, plant tissue, and other materials. Samples are preserved, barcoded, and cataloged with accompanying metadata in a database. This database of bar-coded samples is searchable online at https://data.hubbardbrook.org/samples/. In 2024, both the underlying collection and sample database and the search interface are being restructured. This effort is resulting in improved collection organization and more detailed sample-level metadata.\nRequests for reanalysis of archived samples (e.g. isotopic analyses, heavy metals, etc.) are received periodically, and have resulted in a number of publications.\nA Sample Archive Committee (SAC) was formed in 2013 to address storage space, future direction, priority for continued bar-coding, etc.\n\n\n1.10.2 Sample Archive Subsampling Policy\nHBR shares these archived samples with scientists upon request. As stewards of these samples, our highest priorities are:\n\nto maintain the chemical integrity of these samples;\nto document the use of these samples, and any resulting changes;\ninform principal investigators of interest in using them;\nto acknowledge the appropriate funding sources for their original collection.\n\nDetails on the subsampling of archived material can be found on the sample request form:\nhttps://hubbardbrook.org/sites/default/files/documents/subsampling_request.pdf\n\n\n1.10.3 Directions for Sample Submission\nRequirements for acceptance of samples into the archive:\n\nAdequate documentation must accompany physical samples.\nSamples are stored in either an unheated large room or a smaller room that is heated to just above freezing. The contributing scientist is responsible for deciding that these conditions are suitable for his/her samples.\nSoil samples must be air or oven-dried and stored in plastic or glass bottles with screw caps to ensure a tight seal. Cardboard is not permitted.\nVegetation samples should be dried, ground and stored in clear plastic or glass containers.\nWater samples must be stored in plastic bottles and will be accepted either treated, or not. If treated, the investigator must specify the type and concentration used.\nAll tree logs, cookies and cores should be air-dried and can be stored in cardboard boxes or arranged in a manner that will allow for air to flow between individual samples. Tree cores should be mounted or stored in straws.\nSamples that are considered toxic may be rejected. The data management committee may confer with the SAC about important, but toxic samples requiring storage.",

HBR data is published in the Environmental Data Initiative Repository (EDI). With the availability of EDI’s ezEML data package builder application (adopted by HBR in 2024), this once long and complicated process has been greatly simplified.\nIn 2024, HBR fully adopted the EDI ezEML workflow for data package development. All data packages are developed under the EDI HBR user account. The division of effort varies with the nature of the data package. Graduate students are encouraged to collaborate with the IM online within the ezEML environment. This serves as a way to directly input metadata without first populating a template, reduces IM time on some data packages, and is an important skill-builder for HBR graduate students. Additionally, some of our investigators have projects beyond the scope of Hubbard Brook and have begun using this workflow to publish data.\nEzEML provides the capability to store often-used metadata components in a template. For HBR, there is one master template and additional templates for HB projects that are frequent publishers (MELNHE, HBWatER, BIRD, CRCH). Since the master template is very extensive, it is not cloned as a starting point for a new dataset (which might be a common template use), but instead accessed through the import [creator, geographic, keywords, project, funding] buttons where just selected items are brought into the current dataset.",

    "text": "2.3 Step-by-Step Data Package Workflow\nThe HBR Data Inventory table is hosted on the HubbardBrook sharepoint site (HBR-IM administrator at UNH). This table contains additional information that we use on our local data catalog to enhance user experience (flagging of significant core datasets, more robust LTER Core Research Area assignments that may be missing in older metadata, and a code to categorize datasets and to sort them in the initial catalog view). Data packages are entered in this table as soon as they are identified (in some cases with very long lead times). Upon becoming aware of a dataset, a package id is assigned and the entry initiated with status=anticipated. As soon as data and/or metadata are in-hand, the status is updated to ‘draft’, ‘cataloged’ when published, and ‘embargoed’ if published with a temporary embargo. The table includes packageID, abbreviated title, contact, notes as needed, flagging as long-term core dataset, and EDI submission status.\nThe steps are as follows:\n\nIn most cases, a very preliminary zoom with data show-and-tell occurs to iron out any major issues and to develop a plan for the composition of the data package.\nProvide submitter with metadata template using email template to outline the process and description of best practices, such as:\n\ntitles with what where when, with the latter YYYY, YYYY-YYYY, or YYYY-ongoing\nDate formats as YYYY-MM-DD, or timestamps as YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm\nMake sure submitter understands tidy tables!\nConfirm that submitter has done rigorous QC and help with this if necessary\nAuthors in the order they should show up on dataset citation\nKeywords from the LTER controlled vocabulary (and additional if necessary)\nNote that commonly used chunks of metadata can be briefly described to IM without detail, such as author details, geographic locations, taxonomy. These will be pulled from the template.\nfunding sources go in the project section, and if a new sNSF ource is supplied the full details can be fetched by just entering the grant number\n\nData package assets are provided to the IM through a sharepoint dropoff (data tables as csv, and ‘other entities’ as necessary\nezEML collaboration is established if desired for the dataset.\nA data package is initiated in ezEML\n\nnaming convention of hbr[pkgid]-[shortname]\nuse document/new or document/new from template\n\nThe HBR Master Template (stored in EDI) is used to import people, geographic areas, keywords, projects, and funding. Add items to the template if they are likely to be used in the future.

At the current time, large datasets are staged on a UNH server with the ezEML distribution URL set to that location. In some cases we develop packages using a smaller placeholder file so that we do not overload storage on the ezEML platform or portal-s staging area.\nFor acceptable size datasets that are nevertheless large, the HBR IM typically checks in with the ezEML developer to make sure that disk space is not an issue at that time. If ezEML upload (or data at a URL) is acceptable at the time, HBR IM can stage and publish and notify ezEML that the files can be deleted from staging.",

Steps are similar to those used for a new dataset, but remember to increment the revision number. Assets for earlier data packages developed can be found in either the ‘EMLassemblyline’ or ‘legacy’ folders, although those files should rarely be necessary once a data package is published in EDI.\nAn EDI fetched dataset may have been developed with a non-ezEML workflow. If that is the case, items requiring attention will be:\n\nCreators – delete and import from the template to be sure to get ORCIDs and institution RORs for each person.\nProject – EMLAL datasets may have funding in ‘related funding’ or a text string in project abstract. Delete these. Import all funding from the template as primary or related. The template will have enhanced information to include grant url, funding agency ROR, etc.\nIntellectual rights will be correct for all older datasets, but it is best to reset that in ezEML to CC-BY selection.\nIncrement the packageId revision number.\nUse re-upload datatable if revision includes new or modified data. This all goes well if the table is identical. If there are new columns, upload as a new table and clone metadata from the original, then define any new columns. If the dataset was prepared in EMLAL, clear min/max bounds.",

This is not 100%, as some papers still slip up on proper data citation, or data publication lags paper publication.

    "text": "6.1 Overview\nThe Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) is operated and maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station. Research at HBEF began in the 1960’s and the research community consists of investigators from numerous institutions across the US (and world). Collectively, this research has been funded by the USDA Forest Service, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, US Geological Survey, other federal grant programs, and private foundation funds. Research projects have generated a wealth of samples, preserved in either the on-site sample archive facility located at HBEF and/or numerous institutional collections (biological voucher samples).\nThe Hubbard Brook Physical Sample Archive was completed in 1990 to permanently store research samples for future use in Hubbard Brook studies. The building provides a special and unique opportunity to maintain a research memory for long term ecosystem studies. To date there are 70,000 barcoded and cataloged samples ranging from water samples to soils and plant parts. Samples from ongoing, long-term collections and shorter-term projects are included. Cataloged samples are accessible on-line in a public searchable database and are available for subsampling in support of new studies and additional analyses. Stored and catalogued samples have been used to address scientific questions and have resulted in additional publications featuring archived sample analysis. [https://www.zotero.org/groups/4549695/hubbard_brook_ecosystem_study/tags/archived_samples/library]\nThe archive is managed to accommodate future sample submissions. Samples from Hubbard Brook are accepted into the archive system if they are likely to be of future use and are accompanied by adequate documentation. Detailed metadata is submitted with each sample and stored in a relational database. The Hubbard Brook website provides browse/search/filter access to the sample database at both the collection and sample level.\nExternal collections have been used extensively since the 1960’s for the preservation of biological voucher specimens. A 2024 assessment of HB voucher samples identified more than 2000 samples in 40+ collections in the US and Canada. With the growing acceptance of digitial (image/audio) vouchers, this number grows to several hundred thousand. Management and policies for samples and specimens in external collections are addressed in a separate document. See voucher sample chapter for more details.",

    "text": "7.1 Background\nThere has been a decades-long history of voucher collections at Hubbard Brook. These were typically ad hoc collections, with no coordinated effort in the destination collections, or reporting to HB leadership. The end result is that several thousand voucher samples can be found in over 40 collections in the US and Canada.\nThe 2024 LTER solicitation includes specific language requiring a plan for handling and potentially archiving specimens collected by LTER sites.\n“For proposals that include specimen collection: If collecting or generating specimens (e.g., organisms, parts of organisms, fossils including trace fossils, microbial isolates, etc.) is proposed, the Data Management Plan must include a description of how the specimens and associated data will be accessioned into and maintained in an established biological collection.”\nAlthough current HB projects not generate many grant-related voucher specimens, this was a good nudge toward determining what had been collected, and to develop recommendations in the event that a grant were to be submitted that required voucher language in the data management plan.",

It is evident that there are some key collections that house Hubbard Brook samples and some of these have well-established relationship with Hubbard Brook. This makes them likely collection candidates for future samples to be collected. This is a work-in-progress and more details are forthcoming as we develop best practices recommendations for the site.",

    "text": "9.0.1 Establishment, configuration, and status  \nUpdated: April 30, 2025  \nIn the early 2010’s COS members requested the establishment of listserv(s) for the Hubbard Brook Community. These notes describe the configuration of the lists. \n\n\n9.0.2 The Lists \nThree primary lists were established in 2014. \n\nHubbardBrook – a general list comprising HB investigators, grad students, techs, and those generally interested in HB work \n\n\n\nHubbardBrookCOS – all members of the COS. Used for official voting and at times when a message could be limited to COS + GRAD lists\n\n\n\nHubbardBrookGrads – all graduate students/postdocs, SCC chairs, LTER leadPIs, HBR IM \n\n\n\nSeveral project-level lists have been established – for instance,  for the  Ice Storm Team  \n\nMembership \n\nControl of list members is by the admin – no self-addition to the list (that opens up a world of spam). Only members can post to lists. If a non-member posts, it is sent to admin for approval and release. \n\n\n\nAddition of list members is by request to the list admin.  \n\n\n\nThe general list contains everyone and there has been no removal (or very little) as folks have moved on from HB \n\n\n\nGrads are kept up-to-date with additions/removals on both the general and grad list. \n\n\n\nIM reaches out to COS several times a year to review grad list and provide updates. \n\n\n\nSCC informs the admin of new members when they are voted in to COS.  \n\n\n\nSome requests for addition come from undergrads, and admin has been adding notation of ‘undergrad’ and ‘year’, so that these can be removed periodically. \n\n\n\n9.0.3 Use patterns \nIn general, the lists have been used for announcements and there has been very little 2-way communication. Initially, this type of list was chosen, since 2-way communication was a requirement in the request from COS to establish lists. Is this something we still need…. \n\n\n9.0.4 Listserv platforms\nThe lists were established and managed by the HBR IM on the mailman listserv platform hosted at UNH-RCC: https://list.org/  https://lists.sr.unh.edu/mailman/listinfo Tech support has been provided by UNH Research Computing Center. Hubbard Brook used this until 2025 until the service was no longer available at UNH. See below for current status\n\n\n9.0.5 The Future of Lists \nIn 2024, a decision was made at UNH to discontinue the mailman list service and all those with lists were asked to migrate to a new system. \nTransitioning to Hubbard Brook Lists 2.0 \nThe Mailman list service at UNH is no longer in operation. The only option for lists at UNH is through Outlook groups. This is a service that is optimized for internal communications and does not function well with a broader community like ours. The longstanding unresolved issue is with DMARC rules at some institutions that cause rejection of messages that do not originate from UNH. For that reason, we do not have full function of two-way conversations on the list. Messages sent from a UNH address are delivered to all, so at the current time the IM forwards messages to the list. There weren’t many interactive list conversations in the past, so this hasn’t been a big issue, but it is annoying.\nOther options have been investigated - using google groups through the HBRF workspace. The limitation here is that the address is either listname@hubbardbrookfoundation.org or listname@googlegroups.com, neither is ideal. Although googlegroups does not require a google account to be a member, there can be some resistance to this. Using the HBRF domain is not ideal as they manage a number of different mailing lists/services and there is already some confusion between list and other mailings.\nFor now, it is UNH Outlook with its limitations. There is some possibility of a UNH revival of the Mailman service which would be idea, as that worked well for a decade.",

    "text": "15.1 Computer Resources/Facilities (UNH/ESRC)\nA section in the Data Management Plan describes the software/hardware regularly used by HBR IM. It also covers IT support and a list of contacts who have access to accounts used by IM (UNH systems, EDI, cloud-based accounts. Link\nThe Earth Systems Research Center’s (ESRC) Science Computing Facility (SCF) has a wide range of computer servers, printers, plotters, archiving systems, software, data archives, and web based data distribution systems that are integrated using several internal networks and connected to the outside world through a high speed pipe. The overall SCF administration is provided by the Research Computing Center (RCC) located in the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space (EOS). Scientific data processing and analysis support is distributed throughout workgroups within the center with additional centralized expertise provided by ESRC’s Laboratory for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. RCC’s Lenharth Data Center was upgraded in September 2011. This upgrade brought in new APC UPS units, energy efficient in-rack cooling systems, and monitoring hardware to provide more space and capability for future growth. Within this proposal, we take advantage of this existing computer infrastructure, to meet our anticipated computational needs.\nThe main ESRC servers consist of high-end, multi-processor computing systems manufactured by Dell. The Dell systems run Linux and are used for CPU intensive jobs, parallel modeling, and storage. Backups and archives are done using BackupPC a disk-to-disk based system. Most of the main servers share a gigabit (Gb) switch with the archive/backup system for high-speed communications. All of this equipment is kept within a physically secured, humidity and temperature controlled data center complete with closed circuit video surveillance and a remotely monitored security alarm system. Final data and image products are produced from several ink-jet plotters and laser printers within the department. Additionally, several CD/DVD writers are used for data distribution.\nEOS includes a CRAY XE6m-200 with 132 nodes, over 4000 processors and 160Tb of storage. In addition, our infrastructure has been strategically upgraded to provide gigabit networking to desktops.\nIndividual scientists and research groups have additional computing resources at their disposal. These include dedicated servers, individual workstations, and various peripheral devices. The group servers and individual workstations include: Linux servers and workstations, Windows workstations, Apple Macintosh desktop and laptop computers. All servers, user systems and networked peripheral devices are accessible within EOS through a gigabit ethernet network. Wireless networking is available throughout the building, including access to EduRoam. These systems also have access to both Internet 1 and Internet 2.\nESRC currently houses a 65TB+ geographically referenced data archive used for spatial data processing and analysis. This archive stored on RAID5 data disks served by a series of data servers, houses global, regional and local, Landsat, MODIS, IKONOS, Hyperion, ASTER, and SPOT satellite imagery, land cover classified products, vegetation and other indexes (EVI, LSWI, NDSI, NDVI, NDWI, LAI), aerial photography and GIS vector data layers for use by all projects within the department. Portions of these data, processed data products, and project results archive are disseminated and distributed through several dozen regularly updated and maintained ESRC operated websites. These websites are served through a variety of web servers running Apache web server software supported by other applications and libraries such as Tomcat, Web Mapping Server (WMS), OpenLayers and other geographically enhanced libraries such as GDAL, PROJ4, and GCTP.\nESRC also leverages the center’s Laboratory for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis, a spatial information processing, analysis and distribution research laboratory. This laboratory provides geographic information system (GIS), Web Mapping, spatial data archiving, data distribution, remote sensing, image processing, cartography, large format printing and scanning support to several ESRC and EOS research projects. Staffed by professional geo-spatial information technicians, computer programmers, and graduate and undergraduate university students, the laboratory houses a multiple seat Linux, PC, and Mac OS computer cluster supplied with a variety of open source Remote Sensing, GIS, web mapping, image processing and cartography software and ESRI ArcGIS, Leica ERDAS Imagine, and IDL/ENVI, commercial site, block, and individually licensed GIS and Image processing software.",
